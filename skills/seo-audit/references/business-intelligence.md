# Phase 0 — Business Intelligence (run FIRST, before any audit work)

> New in Claude SEO Pro. The moment a user runs a full audit, **before** crawling for
> SEO issues, Claude builds a structured understanding of the business. Everything
> downstream — which markets to research keywords in, which ICPs to evaluate intent
> for, whether local/GBP even applies — depends on this. A keyword report for the
> wrong country or persona is worse than none.
>
> This phase is **autonomous**: infer silently, write the profile artifact, and
> continue into the audit + keyword research without pausing. Surface the inferred
> profile in the final report's opening section so the manager can sanity-check it.

## Inputs Claude reads (evidence-first, per the Evidence Integrity Protocol)

1. The pre-fetched homepage + key pages already on disk (never re-fetch / never guess).
2. Specifically mine: `<title>`, meta description, H1/H2s, hero copy, nav labels,
   footer (addresses, phones, registration numbers), `/about`, `/contact`,
   `/services`, `/our-company`, client/logo strips, testimonials, schema JSON-LD
   (Organization/LocalBusiness `address`, `areaServed`, `sameAs`), language/`hreflang`,
   currency and phone country codes, shipping / service-area statements.
3. If DataForSEO is available: `business_data` listing + `dataforseo_labs` ranked
   keywords give the *observed* country/language footprint to corroborate inference.

## What Claude infers (LLM reasoning, grounded in the above)

Produce a `business-profile.json` (write to the audit output dir) with these fields.
Every non-trivial field carries a `confidence` (high/medium/low) and the `evidence`
(file + snippet) it rests on — unsupported inferences are marked `low` and flagged,
never asserted.

## How to reason well here (LLM guidance)

- **Country of origin ≠ only target market.** Read shipping/areaServed/currency/phone
  codes and language variants. A Dubai firm with Riyadh service pages is targeting KSA
  too — capture it as a target market (drives multi-locale keyword research).
- **Model dictates intent.** B2B → research commercial / transactional + comparison
  terms and longer-tail; B2C local → "near me", city-modified; ecommerce → product +
  category + "buy". Set `seed_keyword_themes` accordingly.
- **Decide `is_local_business` deliberately.** Physical premises, service area, GBP
  signals, "near me" relevance → true → the audit MUST run the Local SEO + GBP phase.
  Pure-online SaaS/publisher → false → skip local, note why.
- **ICPs drive persona scoring** later (seo-sxo) and the keyword *intent* filter.
- **Stay evidence-bound.** If the site doesn't reveal a target market, don't invent
  one — mark `low` confidence or omit. The profile is a hypothesis set, labelled as such.

## Output of Phase 0

1. `business-profile.json` on disk (consumed by Keyword Research + Local/GBP phases).
2. A short "Business Understanding" block reproduced at the top of the final report:
   model, country, target markets, ICPs, and the seed themes — each tagged with
   confidence — so the SEO manager can correct a wrong inference in one glance.

Then proceed automatically to the templatized audit (`audit-playbook.md`),
the keyword research (`keyword-research.md`), and — if `is_local_business` —
the local/GBP phase (`local-gbp-audit.md`).
